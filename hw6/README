1) Create an interactive session
  "qsub -I -l walltime=hr:min:sec" where hr = 03 is a safe amount of time

  "module avail" to pick whatever python 2.7 distribution
3) Load the python distribution
  "module load (name of package found using "module avail")"
4) Run the script!
  "python mergesort_test.py"
