To run the code that creates two particles and computes the force between them, end "python particle_test.py".  This script imports the "particle_class.py" module that houses the source for the Position, Velocity, and Particle classes.

-- Directions for Hyak --

1) Create an interactive session
  "qsub -I -l walltime=hr:min:sec" where hr = 3 is a safe amount of time
2) Find your favorite python distribution (2.7 for this code)
  "module avail" to pick whatever python 2.7 distribution
3) Load the python distribution
  "module load (name of package found using "module avail")"
4) Run the script!
  "python particle_test.py" to output the force between particles p1, p2
