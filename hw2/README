Runs the code that creates a linked list class object, inserts 3 values at the head, deletes one at the head, then inserts 3 at the tail. them.  To run, enter  "python linkedlist.py".

1) Create an interactive session
  "qsub -I -l walltime=hr:min:sec" where hr = 03 is a safe amount of time
2) Find your favorite python distribution (2.7 for this code)
  "module avail" to pick whatever python 2.7 distribution
3) Load the python distribution
  "module load (name of package found using "module avail")"
4) Run the script!
  "python linkedlist.py"

(c) In part (b), why do we not have a function with the below signature?
We do not have a delete_at_tail() function because in order to read the tail for a linked list of length n, we have to traverse n-1 elements such that we can then pop the nth element and let the n-1th element know that it's the current tail.  This is quite inefficient relative to the other linked list methods, like insert_at_head(), which take of order O(1) time and are must quicker.
